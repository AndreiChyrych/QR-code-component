I was dead stuck with centering the flexbox/items before discovering this solution. My mistake was not setting the width: 100% to the img. 

Things that i dont understand: 
1. Why do we need to use margin/padding to center the flexbox itmes if < body > is flexbox container with align-items/justify-content: center;?
2. If < body > is flexbox container, do we still need to use: < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" > ?
3. Necessity of * { } in that specific solution?
